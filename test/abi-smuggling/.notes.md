### Notes on test setup

- 3 accounts: `deployer`, `player`, `recovery`
- **vault**: the `SelfAuthorizedVault` contract is deployed

- Permissions:
    - **player** can call the `withdraw (0xd9caed12)` function on the vault
    - **deployer** can call the `sweepFunds (0x85fb709d)` function on the vault

- **vault** is `initialized`
- **DVT token** are sent to the vault

### Notes on the AuthorizedExecutor::execute function

This method is an `external` `nonReentrant` function. It only allows to execute permissioned actions previously setup via the `setPermissions` method. Hence, I should be able to perform the permissioned actions leveraging this **execute** function.

**Recon**: The `deployer` account can call the `sweepFunc` method.

The execute function signature is as follows:

``` js
function execute(address target, bytes calldata actionData) external nonReentrant returns (bytes memory) 
```

As the deployer, I can use this to call the `sweepFund` in a more "low level way":
- I can wrap the `sweepFunds()` function call into the `actionData` parameter that the `execute` function accepts.

Let's the ABI encode the input parameters that the `sweepFunds` needs:

```js
    const sweepFundsEncodedParams = defaultAbiCoder.encode(
        ["address", "address"], 
        [recovery.address, token.address])
```

This results in having this hex string: `0x0000000000000000000000003c44cdddb6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12fa4293bc0000000000000000000000005fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3`

In front of this we can append the `sweepFunds` function **selector**: `0x85fb709d`.

As a final result this long hex string represent a call to the `sweepFunds` function:
`0x85fb709d0000000000000000000000003c44cdddb6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12fa4293bc0000000000000000000000005fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3`

So the by calling the execute function with `actionData` set equal to that long hex string, the execute function will call the `sweepFunds` function and send all the funds to a receiver encoded in that long hex string: the `revocery` account.
